My example of an unstructured text that can be valuable for reporting is sports obituaries. This one link is to a New York Times obituary on Dave Mirra, a BMX bike legend: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/sports/david-mirra-iconic-bmx-bike-racer-dies-in-an-apparent-suicide.html . The story is about his suicide, but it can also be separated into different groups such as name, age at death, date of birth, cause of death, sport, and others as needed. This way, journalists can determine correlations between sports and certain types of deaths. So if there was a story about how concussions are prevalent in football players, if we structured sports obituaries, finding out what football players died as a cause of a concussion would be easier. It can be presented in a spreadsheet, or a sortable program that scans for football players that died from concussions. It could also be done for sports in general, and would make finding out, for example, what athletes died as a result of suicide easier. Should one use the article about Dave Mirra, the spreadsheet or program would include data like his name, his age (41), his sport (BMX), cause of death (suicide), and anything else considered relevant. After adding enough athletes, one would be able to come up with better conclusions about the athletes and why they died.
